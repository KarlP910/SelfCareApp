# Good Space

## 💡 Inspiration
- We came accross this idea because the pandemic had a pretty negative effect on people so we thought we might try to create something that could cheer them up.
- Also it was a category for the PolyHacks Hackathon 2022 so we thought it would be a great idea to help some people 

## 💻 What it does
- It's a website that regroup multiple techniques to mitigate stress and anxiety.You can really take care of your mental health and be better emotionnaly.
- It regroups 4 principle techniques like relaxing music, motivationnal quotes, a journal and some yoga/breathing exercices

## ⚙️ How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Coil: For web monetization
- Hedera: For smart contract
- Firebase: For user authentication
- Firestore: For Database

## 💲 Best Web Monetization Project

We also use Coil to create micropayments for the user you wish, to support them and hence motivate them to keep helping the community. The coil is a free, open-source, and open-source-compliant web monetization platform that allows you to monetize your website for a small fee.

<!-- Optional(If we are able to implement it) -->

## 🔐 MLH- Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

Hedera is a decentralized public network that utiltizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.

## ⛅ MLH- Best Use of Google Cloud

We are using Firebase for database and authentication. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable real-time, high-performance database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Firebase is a free service and easy to use.

## 🌐 MLH- Best Domain Name from Domain.com

- Any domain name with .tech, eg longitude.tech . We will choose the best domain name among all.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- As all the hackers were from different time zones, it was a bit difficult to collaborate, but we managed to get the project done.
- We were building an Application for the first time, so we had to learn the basics of React Native which took some time.
- We have some challenges with the backend, but we managed to get the project done.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- As it was the first time working with Coil, we were able to build a web monetization feature.
- Completing the project within the given time frame.
- Creating a fully functional application.

## 📖 What we learned

- We learned how to use the best tools and frameworks to make the project work.
- How to use Coil and add web monetization to the website.
- How to implement Firebase authentication and Firestore database.
- How to use Hedera for the smart contract.

## 🚀 What's next for Good Space

- Adding more features to the application.
