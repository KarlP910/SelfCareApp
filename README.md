# Good Space

## üí° Inspiration

- The pandemic had a negative effects on many people. As one of the categories for PolyHacks Hackathon 2022 is self-care, we wanted to make a webapp that helps people relax and learn techniques to improve mindfulness, physical and mental health.

## üíª What it does

- It's a website providing different techniques for users to better their mental and physical health.
- There are 4 main features:
    - Journal to record positive moments so user can revisit them for encouragement
    - Relaxing selection of music to improve sleep, relaxation and focus
    - Meditation and yoga/breathing exercises to improve physical health and reduce anxiety 
    - Chatroom to connect with other users on the same journey

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

- React Js: For frontend
- Coil: For web monetization
- Hedera: For smart contract and user information
- Firebase: For user authentication
- Firestore: For Database

## üí≤ Best Web Monetization Project

We also use Coil to create micropayments for the user you wish, to support them and hence motivate them to keep helping the community. The coil is a free, open-source, and open-source-compliant web monetization platform that allows you to monetize your website for a small fee.

## üîê MLH- Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera

We are using Hedera to show your Account Info, Crypto Transfer, Contract Call, Contract Deploy. Hedera is a decentralized public network that utiltizes the Hashgraph consensus algorithm to overcome the traditional limitations of blockchain and allow one to create next era of fast, fair, and secure applications.

## ‚õÖ MLH- Best Use of Google Cloud

We are using Firebase for database and authentication. Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable real-time, high-performance database for mobile, web, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Firebase is a free service and easy to use.

## üåê MLH- Best Domain Name from Domain.com

- Any domain name with .tech, eg longitude.tech . We will choose the best domain name among all.

## üß† Challenges we ran into

- As all the teammates were from different time zones, it was a bit difficult to collaborate, but we managed to get the project done.
- Some of us did not have any experience with Firebase or backend. We collaborated and helped each other get up to speed. We managed to get most features we want working.

## üèÖ Accomplishments that we're proud of

- It was the first time working with Coil but we were able to build a web monetization feature.
- Completing the project within the given time frame.
- Creating a fully functional application.

## üìñ What we learned

- We learned how to use the best tools and frameworks to make the project work.
- How to use Coil and add web monetization to the website.
- How to implement Firebase authentication and Firestore database.
- How to use Hedera for the smart contract.

## üöÄ What's next for Good Space

- A mobile app version
- Search feature for journals, music, exercise
- Recommendation feature using AI to recommend music or yoga/breathing exercises based on preferences.
